        This is a game created by
        <a href="https://spencerchang.me">spencer</a> and
        <a href="https://kelschen.com/">kelsey</a> for the
        <a href="https://taper.badquar.to/">8th issue of taper</a>, a
        computational poetry magazine. The idea is a subversion of the classic
        pacman, where instead of eating food, the player eats words to make
        their own poem. The words come from a very limited word bank, but
        because they are curated to be multipurpose, the limited word set and
        constraints of movement on the grid provide a lot of fun playability.
        Play around! Your poems will save automatically (local to your browser)
        and you can optionally submit them to the
        <a href="https://coda.io/@spencer/pacman-poem-submissions"
          >public gallery</a
        >.

        An 8-ball is reimagined as an 8-bit game reimagined as a poetry machine.
        Readers play the game using their arrow keys to move the 8-ball around
        to consume words. Rather than collecting points like in Pacman, readers
        eat words and punctuations to create their own poem, which automatically
        fills in the space below the grid. The grid is filled with a select
        number of random words from a pre-filled work bank for each part of
        speech, including punctuation, and the game is over when all words have
        been consumed. Replay variety is amplified through randomization and
        words that multitask in sentence function (e.g. as both verb and noun),
        despite a limited word bank. Toying with consumption (eight=ate), luck
        (8-ball), constraint (the 4 directions), and poetic composition (with 8
        words in a grid of 16), 8-Bite is a playful poetic contraption that
        literally makes you eat your words. How do you win a game of poetry?
        What happens when luck is a functional constraint on beauty?

        What does it mean to create poetry by eating your words (taking things
        back) in an irretractable gameplay?
